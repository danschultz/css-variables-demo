# CSS Variables + Media Queries Demo

Simple demo to test media queries and CSS variables for defining breakpoints.
Uses [postcss-css-variables] for supporting CSS variables inside media queries.
This tool does have some caveats, but should be spec compliant in terms of using
variables inside media queries and selectors.

## Running

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run build`
3. `yarn run serve`
4. `open http://localhost:8080`
